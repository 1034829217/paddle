# DSH-pytorch
PyTorch implementation of paper [Deep Supervised Hashing for Fast Image Retrieval](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Liu_Deep_Supervised_Hashing_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

And thanks to [This repo on TensorFlow](https://github.com/yg33717/DSH_tensorflow)

## Result
I only tested it once as it has been pushed, and it seems to be able to reproduce the result claimed on the paper.

More results will be added...

# How to Run
I intended to make it easy for reading. You can easily run it by
```
python main.py
```
commandline uasge have a nice-looking help
```
